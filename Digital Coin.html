		<h2>What is a 'Blockchain'</h2>
	<p>A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the Bitcoin network. The blockchain has complete information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.

		<h1>Digital Coin</h1>
		<h2>Definition - What does Digital Currency mean?</h2>
		
		<p>Digital currency is a payment method which exists only in electronic form and is not tangible. Digital currency can be transferred between entities or users with the help of technology like computers, smartphones and the internet. Although it is similar to physical currencies, digital money allows borderless transfer of ownership as well as instantaneous transactions. Digital currencies can be used to purchase goods and services but can also be restricted to certain online communities such as a gaming or social networks.

		Digital currency is also known as digital money and cybercash.</p>
	<h2>BREAKING DOWN 'Blockchain</h2>
		
		<p>The blockchain is seen as the main technological innovation of Bitcoin, since it stands as proof of all the transactions on the network. A block is the ‘current’ part of a blockchain which records some or all of the recent transactions, and once completed goes into the blockchain as permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated. There is a countless number of such blocks in the blockchain. So are the blocks randomly placed in a blockchain? No, they are linked to each other (like a chain) in proper linear, chronological order with every block containing a hash of the previous block.
			To use conventional banking as an analogy, the blockchain is like a full history of banking transactions. Bitcoin transactions are entered chronologically in a blockchain just the way bank transactions are. Blocks, meanwhile, are like individual bank statements.
			Based on the Bitcoin protocol, the blockchain database is shared by all nodes participating in a system. The full copy of the blockchain has records of every Bitcoin transaction ever executed. It can thus provide insight about facts like how much value belonged a particular address at any point in the past.
			The ever-growing size of the blockchain is considered by some to be a problem due to issues like storage and synchronization. On an average, every 10 minutes, a new block is appended to the block chain through mining.

		<h1>Types of Digital Currencies and how they work.</h1>
		
		<h2>Ethereum</h2>
			<p style="border:1px solid #D81B60; border-radius:5px; padding:5px">Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that  features smart contract functionality. It offers the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a decentralized virtual machine that executes peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency known as ether. The Ethereum platform allows multiple uses concerning smart contracts. With Ethereum, you can safely do business with a person you don’t know; because all terms are spelled out in a “smart contract” entrenched in the blockchain.
			</p>
			
	<h2>Ripple</h2>
		<p style="border:1px solid #D81B60; border-radius:5px; padding:5px">	Ripple is a real-time currency exchange, remittance network, and settlement system. It offers instant, certain, low-cost international payments. Also known as Ripple protocol or the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP), it is built upon a decentralized open source Internet protocol and native currency referred to as XRP (ripples). Bases around public ledger, Ripple uses a consensus process to all exchange, remittance and payments in distributed process
		</p>
	<h2>Litecoin</h2>
		<p style="border:1px solid #D81B60; border-radius:5px; padding:5px">	Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency released under the MIT/X11 license. The currency is Inspired by and technically almost identical to bitcoin. Litecoin formation and transfer is based on an open source protocol
		</p>
	<h2>Dogecoin</h2>
		<p style="border:1px solid #D81B60; border-radius:5px; padding:5px">		Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is largely based on the Bitcoin protocol, but with some modifications. The currency uses the technology of scrypt as a proof-of-work scheme. Its block time is 60 seconds. There is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be produced. The digital currency deals with many coins that are lesser in value individually. Therefore, it has low entry barrier and good for carrying out smaller transactions
		</p>
	<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
		<p style="border:1px solid #D81B60; border-radius:5px; padding:5px">		Bitcoin is a digital currency created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Like other currencies, bitcoin can be used to buy items locally and electronically. As a new user, you can use Bitcoin without understanding all its technical details. Once you install a Bitcoin wallet on your mobile phone or computer, it will generate the first Bitcoin address and you can generate more whenever you need them. After creating bitcoins, you can use them for all types of real transactions
